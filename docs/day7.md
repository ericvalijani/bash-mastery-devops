> This file is kept only for archival purposes and internal search.  
> All up-to-date, rich, and high-visibility content lives in **README.md** to maximize exposure and impact.

**Best practice used by top open-source projects (Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, etc.):**

> - **README.md** = Marketing + Onboarding + Showcase  
> - **docs/** = Deep-dive technical reference + Archive

This keeps the project professional, recruiter-friendly, and star-magnet while maintaining perfect organization.
